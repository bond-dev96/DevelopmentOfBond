About me and this page.
Name is Randall Bond, I am 28 years old, I have a fianc칠e I've been with for going on 14 years, two children, one boy who is 8 years old; and one girl who is 6 years old. Currently a student at DeVry University studying Software Design and Development, currently on the Dean's list, GPA never below a 3.86 . Decided on going to college for this cause it was something I love and it has good job security, the salary isn't bad either. Also went to elevate my family's well-being as well as show my kids anything is possible as long as you put in hard work.
Thank you and God Bless. 游비游비游비游비游비游비游비
